Once upon a time not so long ago\
When humans only dreamt of the moon\
They sent a little dog into space
Her name was Laika.
A smart dog, she was part of humanity's first foray into the cosmos.\
With their hopes and dreams, her mission was to land on the moon.
As her ship exited the Earth, she entered a vast unknown world.
It was beautiful.
But good things rarely last.
