Laika (Neutral): Who are you?

"Alien Cat": My name is Keeki. I am a guardian of this planet.
Laika: I'm Laika! I was supposed to be orbiting Earth, but somehow my space ship was pulled away from orbit.
"Alien Cat": It appears that you were caught in the wake of a passing spacecraft's warp drive.
"Alien Cat": The turbulence ripped off parts of your ship and scattered them across our planet. It caused quite a commotion.
Laika (Disappointed): I... I'm so sorry, this was never meant to happen.
update Laika [ mirrored="true"]
Laika: And the ship is in bad shape... I can't possibly finish my mission now.
"Alien Cat": Worry not, my friends have collected the parts of your ship.

"Alien Cat": They are usually delighted to welcome visitors, but they are quite upset at the moment. If you help repair what you have broken, I am sure they will be willing to return those parts to you.
Laika (Starstruck): R-really? I'll do anything I can to help! I need to finish my mission no matter what!
"Alien Cat" (Happy): I am glad to hear it. Here is a map of all the locations where the parts were found.
